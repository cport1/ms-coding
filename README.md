## Application State
Install the [Redux Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) Chrome Extension to view the state initialization. Upon initialization the accounts list is stored in the Application State.

## @ngrx
* The application state uses @ngrx/core and @ngrx/store to store the application state. 
* Side effects (async calls / Redux Saga) are handled through @ngrx/effects.
* Redux Devtools is available through @ngrx/store-devtools and @ngrx/store-log-monitor

## Ascending Service
The ascending method can be found in src/app/services/get-accounts.service.ts
